# 165777-CAT-2-Cedric-Kagumba


## Project Overview
This repository contains Java code for the CAT 2 assignment, where we implement various object-oriented programming concepts such as:
- Encapsulation
- Method Overloading and Overriding
- Abstraction
- Exception Handling

## Classes Included
- `Student.java`: Implements encapsulation with getter and setter methods.
- `MathOperations.java`: Demonstrates method overloading.
- `Animal.java`: Shows method overriding with polymorphism.
- `Appliance.java`: An abstract class with a concrete implementation.
- `Division.java`: Exception handling for division by zero.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Compile the Java files: `javac *.java`
3. Run the program: `java <class-name>`
